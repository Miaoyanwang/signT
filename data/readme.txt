Binary tensor:

Preferable: 
one continuous + one binary; 
modern data (>2015); 
one on medical science (e.g. brain MFI) + one on social science (e.g. social networks)
avoid temporal data


brain_binary_IQ.RData (preferred): brain connectivity data (no response). Not used yet. 

bbnet68_spatial_orientation.RData (neutral): brain connectivity data (no response). supervised version used in matrix regression paper. Unsupervised version has not been used yet. 

alyawarradata.mat (not preferred): kinship data. same data used in my JMLR paper

dnations.mat (not preferred): nations political data. Same data used in my JMLR paper. Supervised version has been used in my tensor regression paper. 

Preferable: 
one continuous + one binary; 
modern data (>2015); 
one on medical science (e.g. brain MFI) + one on social science (e.g. social networks)
avoid time-series data
