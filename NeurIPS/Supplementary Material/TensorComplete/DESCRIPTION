Description: Efficient algorithms for nonparametric tensor completion via sign series. This package provides the nonparametric completion tool for estimating tensor signals from noisy, possibly incomplete observations. The algorithms employ the alternating optimization. The detailed algorithm description can be found in the main paper.
